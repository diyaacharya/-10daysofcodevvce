Correlation is a measure of the association between two variables.

 When we do not know the distribution of the variables, we must use nonparametric rank correlation methods.
 
   Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation can be calculated in Python using the spearmanr() SciPy function.

The function takes two real-valued samples as arguments and returns both the correlation coefficient in the range between -1 and 1 and the p-value for interpreting the significance of the coefficient.
example:

from scipy.stats import spearmanr
x = [1, 2, 3]

x_corr = [2, 4, 6]
corr, p_value = spearmanr(x, x_corr)
print corr
OUTPUT
1.0
print p_value
OUTPUT
0.0

x_uncorr = [5, 6, 5]
corr, p_value = spearmanr(x, x_uncorr)
print corr
OUTPUT
0.0
print p_value
OUTPUT
1.0
